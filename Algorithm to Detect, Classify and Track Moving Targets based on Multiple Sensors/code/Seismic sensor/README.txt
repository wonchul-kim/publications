-------------- Saving seismic data ---------------
------------------------------------------------------

- 1. Install 'Arduino sketch' and run the 'geosampler' 
- 2. connect the arduino mega board with computer and set the port number 
- 3. upload the code into the board by clicking the 'upload'
- 4. now the board is reading the data from seismic sensor
- 5. run the matlab and open 'getSeismicData.m' file  
- 6. plug in the Xbee bluetooth module to the computer and check the port number
- 7. before runing the 'getSeismicData.m' file, need to open each xbee port
- 8. after opening each xbee port, run the 'getSeismicData.m' file by pressing the F5 button
- 9. now the data read by arduino mega board is flowing into the matlab and saved as csv file in the current folder
